The world of Akhenov is a vast ring floating in the void.
How vast is it, you may ask ?
Well, it is long enough so that it would take years to travel all its length on foot.
However, if you just wanted to travel in the orthogonal direction, it wouldn't be very long.
It would still take several months, depending where you'd travel, but definitely less than a year.

Akhenov is not one of those cold dead world.
A bright and powerful fire moves randomly in every direction in its center.
It sometimes moves up, sometimes a bit down, sometimes to the east, or sometimes to the south.
Because of this, the temperature of the inner part of the ring is always changing.
However, the outer part tends to be less affected by the changes.
Because it is not lit by the fire, it is cooler.
Thanks to the many climates, life on Akhenov is diverse.
However, the ever changing temperatures in the lit part of the ring means that most species have to be adapted to the sudden unexpected variations.
On the ever-night part, species have to be adapted to the cold.
The temperature in the crust varies less.
It is still warmer on the day side, and colder on the night side.

The variation of temperatures have a strong influence on Akhenov's weather.
The weather always changes.
Weather science is a complex science.
Yet, weather science on Akhenov would be much more complex than most worlds.
In practical terms, it is impossible to predict what the weather will be like on the internal face.
On the external one, this is only a tiny bit easier.
The atmospheres is still very much under the influence of the brownian motion of the internal star.

## Theme choice

As I hadn't any particular preference over the form of the world, I have written a Python script to choose it for me.
This is a tool which allowed me to think about multiple possibilities, and in the end, selecting one at random, one which I would likely not have thought about.

```python
from random import uniform

# Form of the universe
#
# As for the other parameters, I've affected probabilities
# to the different choices.
# I fought some where more interesting than others.
WORLD_FORMS = {
        "globe in universe": 1,
        "infinite earth": 1,
        "infinite caves": 1,
        "infinite water": 0.5,
        "giant tree": 1,
        "ring": 1,
        "belly of huge animal": 1
        }

# Average temperatures
#
# This doesn't mean there is no variation/
# Yet it allows to devide whether it's an ice age, or whether
# there is no ice at the poles
WORLD_MEAN_TEMPERATURES = {
        "cold": 1,
        "medium": 1,
        "hot": 1,
        "always changing": 1.2
        }

# Average dryness
DRYNESS = {
        "dry": 0.5,
        "medium": 1,
        "wet": 0.5
        }

# This is a utility function, allowing
# to use the above-defined dict
def get_random_elem(proba_dict: dict):
    proba_total = 0 
    for key in proba_dict:
        proba_total += proba_dict[key]
    r = uniform(0, proba_total)
    t = 0
    for key in proba_dict:
        if proba_dict[key] != 0:
            t += proba_dict[key]
            if t > r:
                return key

# Return a random world
def get_world():
    world = {
        "form": get_random_elem(WORLD_FORMS),
        "temp": get_random_elem(WORLD_MEAN_TEMPERATURES),
        "dryness": get_random_elem(DRYNESS)
        }
    return world

print(get_world())
```

In the end, the script returned the following world :

```python
{'form': 'ring', 'temp': 'always changing', 'dryness': 'medium'}
```

This is the base for our world.
